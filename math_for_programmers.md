# Floating point numbers

## Types of Number

- **real numbers**

All numbers on the number line. [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number)

- **integers** 

Integer - is a number that can be written without a fractional component. The set of integers consists of zero (0), the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, …), also called whole numbers or counting numbers, and their additive inverses (the negative integers, i.e. −1, −2, −3, …). [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer)

- **fractions**

Fraction - not an integer. A fraction (from Latin fractus, "broken") represents a part of a whole or, more generally, any number of equal parts. [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics))

- **rational numbers**

A rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction p/q of two integers, a numerator p and a non-zero denominator q. Since q may be equal to 1, every integer is a rational number. The set of all rational numbers, often referred to as "the rationals", is usually denoted by a boldface **Q**; it was thus denoted in 1895 by Giuseppe Peano after quoziente, Italian for "quotient". [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number)

- **irrational numbers** 

An irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers, i.e. as a fraction. Therefore, irrational numbers, when written as decimal numbers, do not terminate, nor do they repeat. For example, the number π starts with 3.14159265358979, but no finite number of digits can represent it exactly and it does not end in a segment that repeats itself infinitely often. The same can be said for any irrational number. [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number)

## Decimal representation

|100's|10's|1's|.|1/10th's|1/100th's|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | |1|.|5| |

= 1 * 1 + 5 * 1/10 = 1 1/2

Move one column to the right => divide value by 10

## Binary representation

|4's|2's|1's|.|1/2th's|1/4ths's|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | |0|.|1|1|

= 1 * 1/2 + 1 * 1/4 = 3/2

Move one column to the right => divide value by 2
